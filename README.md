# GNOME Speech2Text

A GNOME Shell extension that adds speech-to-text functionality using [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model. Speak into your microphone and have your words automatically typed wherever your cursor is.

Note: This extension requires an external background service [gnome-speech2text-service](https://pypi.org/project/gnome-speech2text-service/). The extension communicates with the service over D-Bus and does not bundle it. The installer in this repo or the setup dialog will install the service for you.

This extension follows GNOME's architectural guidelines by using a separate D-Bus service for speech processing, making it lightweight and suitable for the GNOME Extensions store. The service is packaged separately and can be installed via pip.

## Architecture

The extension consists of two components:

1. **GNOME Extension** (lightweight UI) - Provides the panel button, keyboard shortcuts, and settings
2. **D-Bus Service** (separate package) - Handles audio recording, speech transcription, and text insertion

This separation ensures the extension follows GNOME's best practices and security guidelines.

## Features

- 🎤 **Speech Recognition** using OpenAI Whisper
- ⌨️ **Automatic Text Insertion** at cursor location (only on X11)
- 🖱️ **Click to Record** from top panel microphone icon
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcut** support (default: Alt+Super+R)
- 🌍 **Multi-language Support** (depending on Whisper model)
- ⚙️ **Easy Configuration** through settings panel
- 🔒 **Privacy-First** - All processing happens locally
- 🖥️ **X11 and Wayland Support**

## Display Server Compatibility

### X11 (Full Support)

- ✅ Text insertion works perfectly
- ✅ Preview dialog with Insert/Copy options
- ✅ Skip preview option for instant text insertion
- ✅ Auto-skip preview option available for X11 sessions

### Wayland (Limited Support)

- ✅ Speech recognition works perfectly
- ⚠️ Text insertion has limitations due to Wayland security restrictions
- ✅ Copy to clipboard always works

## Requirements

### System Dependencies

- GNOME Shell 46 or later (tested up to GNOME 48)
- Python 3.8 or later
- FFmpeg (for audio recording)
- xdotool (for text insertion on X11 only)
- Clipboard tool: xclip/xsel (X11) or wl-clipboard (Wayland)

### Installation of System Dependencies

Before installing the extension, make sure you have the required system packages:

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
# For X11 sessions
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv ffmpeg xdotool xclip

# For Wayland sessions
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv ffmpeg wl-clipboard
```

**Note:** This extension has been tested extensively on Ubuntu 24.04 / GNOME 46 / X11+Wayland and Ubuntu 25.04 / GNOME 48 / X11+Wayland. It should work on other GNOME Shell 46+ distributions with the above packages installed, but hasn't been tested on other platforms yet.

### GNOME 48 Compatibility Notes

On GNOME 48 with Wayland, the extension automatically disables cursor hover effects to prevent shell crashes. This is a known compatibility issue with cursor handling in this specific environment. All functionality remains intact - buttons simply won't show hand cursors on hover.

## Installation

### GNOME Extensions Store

⌛ **Pending Approval**: This extension is planned for the GNOME Extensions website. Once available, follow these steps:

**Installation from GNOME Extensions Store (when available):**

1. Visit [GNOME Extensions](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/XXXX/gnome-speech2text/) (link will be available after approval)
2. Click "Install" to add the extension
3. The extension will automatically detect that the D-Bus service is missing
4. Follow the setup dialog to install the required service (automatically downloads from PyPI)
5. Restart GNOME Shell to complete the installation

**Note:** The extension package is lightweight and follows GNOME guidelines. The D-Bus service is installed separately as a Python package from PyPI.

### Quick Installation (Recommended)

For the easiest installation experience, use the installation script:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kavehtehrani/gnome-speech2text.git
cd gnome-speech2text

# Run the installation script
./install.sh
```

This script will:

- Check system dependencies and guide you through installing any missing ones
- Install the D-Bus service automatically (from local source or PyPI)
- Install the GNOME extension and compile schemas
- Apply compatibility fixes for GNOME 48/Wayland automatically
- Provide instructions for restarting GNOME Shell
- Give you clear next steps to start using the extension

### First Time Setup

The extension automatically detects if the required service is missing and provides a user-friendly setup dialog with automatic or manual installation options.

**For Full Repository Installation:**

- Creates a Python virtual environment
- Installs the `gnome-speech2text-service` package from local source
- Installs required Python packages (OpenAI Whisper, etc.)
- Sets up D-Bus service files

**For GNOME Extensions Store Installation:**

- Downloads the installation script from GitHub
- Creates a Python virtual environment
- Installs the `gnome-speech2text-service` package from PyPI
- Installs required Python packages (OpenAI Whisper, etc.)
- Sets up D-Bus service files

### Alternative: Service-Only Installation

If you only want to install the D-Bus service (for development or advanced users):

```bash
# Install just the service from local source
cd service/
./install.sh --local

# Or install from PyPI
cd service/
./install.sh --pypi
```

The service is available as a Python package on PyPI: `gnome-speech2text-service`

#### IMPORTANT: Restart GNOME Shell After Installation

**For X11 sessions:**

1. Press `Alt+F2`
2. Type `r`
3. Press `Enter`

**For Wayland sessions:**

1. Log out of your current session
2. Log back in

#### Troubleshooting Installation

If the extension doesn't appear in GNOME Extensions:

```bash
# View extension logs
journalctl -f | grep -E "(gnome-shell|gnome-speech2text-service|speech2text|ffmpeg|org\.gnome\.Speech2Text)"

# Check installation status
make status

# Verify schema compilation
make verify-schema

```

If the D-Bus service isn't working:

```bash
# Check if service is running
dbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.Speech2Text /org/gnome/Speech2Text org.gnome.Speech2Text.GetServiceStatus

# Start the service manually
~/.local/share/gnome-speech2text-service/gnome-speech2text-service

# Check D-Bus service file
ls ~/.local/share/dbus-1/services/org.gnome.Speech2Text.service
```

You can read more about the D-Bus service here: [D-Bus Service Documentation](./service/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

### GNOME Shell Crashes (GNOME 48/Wayland)

If you experience GNOME Shell crashes when using the extension (particularly on Ubuntu 25 / GNOME 48 / Wayland), use the crash analysis script:

```bash
# After a crash, run the debug script
./debug-crash.sh
```

This script will analyze system logs and generate a detailed crash report. Choose option 1 (last 30 minutes) after experiencing a crash. The script will create a timestamped file with all relevant crash information.

### Text Insertion Not Working

1. **On X11**: Ensure xdotool is installed
2. **On Wayland**: Text insertion is limited - use Copy to Clipboard instead
3. Check if target application accepts simulated keyboard input

### Viewing System Logs

```bash
# Extension logs
journalctl -f | grep -E "(gnome-shell|gnome-speech2text-service|speech2text|ffmpeg|org\.gnome\.Speech2Text)"

# Service is D-Bus activated; run it directly to view output
~/.local/share/gnome-speech2text-service/gnome-speech2text-service

# Generate comprehensive crash report
./debug-crash.sh
```

## Uninstallation

### Gnome Extensions

You should be able to uninstall the extension directly using the GNOME Extensions tool.
